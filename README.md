# Learning to Rank - Project 2 - Information Retrieval and Data Mining UCL

We use this code to generate the report for this project.

- ManualLogisticRegression.py -> Logistic Regression for Ranking from Scratch. Tested with a sample. Verification of improvement of the Loss Function.

- SklearnLogisticRegression.py -> Parameter Tuning, Predictions, ERR, NDCG Evaluation of the Logistic Regression Model

- Evaluation_ERR_NDCG_FINAL.ipynb -> Evaluates the resulting scores from Lemur calculates the NDCG@10 and the ERR@10.

- IRDM_CW_TF_LogReg -> Code for the TensorFlow Implementation of Logistic Regression and for its evaluation using ERR and NDCG
- MeshGrid -> Code for tuning the parameters of the LEMUR models.
- Confusion_matrix.ipynb -> Code for analysing results.
